#  AI Voice Assistant

**Jarvis AI Voice Assistant** is a Python-based voice assistant that utilizes the power of the OpenAI API to provide intelligent responses to user queries. It allows you to interact with your computer, open websites, get the current time, play music, and even have conversations with an AI model.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: The voice assistant uses the `speech_recognition` library to understand your voice commands.

- **OpenAI Integration**: It can interact with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate responses based on your prompts.

- **Web Browsing**: Easily open websites like YouTube, Wikipedia, and Google by voice command.

- **Music Playback**: Play your favorite music with a simple voice command.

- **Time Display**: Get the current time on demand.

## Installation

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-ai-voice-assistant.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

3. Configure your OpenAI API key by adding it to the `config.py` file.

4. Run the `jarvis.py` script to start the voice assistant:
